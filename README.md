# Project Showcase

This repository contains the dynamic HTML code for the showcase website as well as code from my projects. The CSS and JavaScript templates were downloaded from https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page291/gamepad and edited. The MATLAB, Labs, and Python folder contain code from my CPP coursework.
